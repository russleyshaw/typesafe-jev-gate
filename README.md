TypeSafe Jev Gate adds a second policy signal before Hermes performs side-effecting tool calls. It classifies the action, redacts sensitive arguments, sends bounded structured state to Jev, and routes the result into Hermes's existing approval flow.

This is a safety layer, not an autonomous permission slip. Hermes hardline blocks, normal authorization, and human approval remain authoritative.

## Why it exists

Tool-using agents need more than a single yes/no check. A request can be technically valid and still be risky because it:

- sends data outside the machine
- repeats an expensive or destructive action
- changes external state when the user's intent is unclear
- contains secrets or prompt-injection content
- arrives while the agent is already performing too many side effects

Jev gives Hermes a typed decision signal for those cases. When Jev is unavailable or uncertain, this plugin fails closed into Hermes approval.

## What it does

- Lets read-only tools and obvious safe terminal commands pass without a network call.
- Evaluates side-effecting tools with redacted, bounded arguments.
- Evaluates paid/external tools such as web search and extraction before they leave the process.
- Escalates repeated calls and excessive side effects in one turn.
- Applies stricter preflight treatment to paid tools.
- Caches Jev decisions briefly to avoid duplicate spend.
- Runs one typed preflight plan before every non-empty main-LLM turn through `pre_llm_call`, covering route, toolset, context, compression, memory, skills, delegation, and retry choices.
- Gives the main model an advisory decision brief so it can choose the smallest useful context and tool path.
- Sends the bounded, redacted turn context available to Hermes with each decision, including conversation history, current model, platform, user message, tool schema, and eligible tool context.
- Validates every typed response against a versioned decision contract before policy code sees it.
- Supports `observe`, `advise`, and `enforce_narrowly` rollout modes plus an emergency `HERMES_JEV_DISABLED=1` network kill switch.
- Blocks clear secret-egress and prompt-injection risks.
- Sends irreversible or uncertain calls to Hermes's normal approval gate.
- Writes metadata-only audit records to `$HERMES_HOME/logs/jev-gate.jsonl`.

## Quick start

### 1. Configure the API key

Use an existing OpenRouter key or create one at <https://openrouter.ai/keys>. Store it as the secret `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the active Hermes profile.

The plugin calls the OpenRouter Decisions API at:

```text
https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha/decisions
```

It uses the `~typesafe/jev-latest` model slug. This is not the normal chat-completions endpoint, and Jev does not replace Hermes's conversational model.

### 2. Enable the plugin

```bash
hermes plugins enable typesafe-jev-gate
```

Restart Hermes or its gateway after enabling it.

## Safety model

```text
Hermes hardline blocks
        ↓
TypeSafe Jev Gate
        ↓
Hermes authorization and approval
        ↓
Tool execution
```

The gate can recommend allow, deny, or approval. It cannot override Hermes's existing authorization rules. A Jev outage, malformed response, or uncertain decision is treated as a reason to ask for approval, not a reason to allow the call.

## Architecture

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `config.py` | Policy constants, context limits, rollout mode, and kill switch |
| `redaction.py` | Tool classification, secret redaction, fingerprints, and safe action summaries |
| `context.py` | Bounded, redacted runtime context assembly |
| `decisions.py` | Versioned typed-choice and score validation |
| `planner.py` | One-call pre-main-LLM route, context, tool, memory, skill, delegation, and retry choices |
| `client.py` | OpenRouter Decisions API client and short-lived cache |
| `policy.py` | Jev request payloads and validated response parsing |
| `budget.py` | Per-turn Jev, repetition, and side-effect budgets |
- `hooks.py` | Hermes hook adapters and approval directives.
- `features.py` | Bounded deterministic request-feature extraction and route safety checks.
- `lifecycle.py` | Typed session, context, skill, quality, and audit-sampling decisions.
- `evaluation.py` | Redacted offline routing corpus and evaluation metrics.
- `metrics.py` | Privacy-safe p50/p95 latency and reliability report from audit metadata.
- `__init__.py` | Minimal plugin entry point.

## Development

Run the test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run linting:

```bash
uv run --with 'ruff>=0.16,<0.17' ruff check .
```

Run the offline routing evaluation and inspect privacy-safe telemetry:

```bash
uv run python scripts/jev_report.py
```

## Project status

This plugin is experimental and tracks the deployed Hermes plugin at version `0.4.0`. The roadmap contracts are implemented with bounded inputs, typed validation, deterministic fallbacks, offline route evaluation, and metadata-only latency/reliability reporting. Review the policy behavior and audit output before enabling it in a production Hermes profile. The project remains conservative: when in doubt, it asks Hermes to ask you.
